# RePlan Optimizer

The optimizer has the sole purpose of generating a release plan. It has been developed as a stateless web service that given all the required information generates a release plan that preserving the stated constraints optimizes the use of the company resources to develop the next release. This web service is powered by the use of a problem optimization algorithm customized for this objective.
